# **lcd** - Leightweight Covid Dashboard
<img align="right" src="images/lcd_sh01.png?raw=true">
There are many good and sophisticated dashboards out there, nevertheless I missed the possibility to compare the current situation in different countries at a glance, especially on mobile devices.

The underlying data comes from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) - data is updated once a day.

The data on the number of residents of the respective countries comes from the World Bank (last update from 2018). The data on the number of residents per case is only a rough indication and will vary considerably locally!

At the time of writing (March 2020) many countries are in the state of exponential growth or about to enter this phase.
Only a few countries, e.g. China and South Korea, seem to have almost halted the further spread of the virus.

Hopefully, other countries will follow in the near future!
